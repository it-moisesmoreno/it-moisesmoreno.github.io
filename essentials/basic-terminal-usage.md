title: Basic Terminal Usage
---

In my opinion learning basic terminal usage is essential for developers, providing a powerful and efficient means to navigate, execute commands, and manage development tasks. The terminalâ€™s text-based interface is often faster and more flexible than graphical alternatives. Many key development tools, such as Git and npm, are primarily operated through the terminal.
