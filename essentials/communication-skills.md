title: Communication Skills
---

Nowadays, good communication skills are required for any job. However, demonstrating these skills through a portfolio can be a bit challenging. Therefore, I showcase my communication abilities by sharing playlists from my YouTube channel and other channels where I've participated. My channel is aligned with my field of expertise and interests, serving as an extension of my portfolio.
